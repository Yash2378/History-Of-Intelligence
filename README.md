# History-Of-Intelligence
Defining Consciousness with historical developments

## Overview

The **History of Intelligence** project is inspired by *The Brief History of Intelligence* by Max Bennett. Our goal is to understand the development of intelligence from both a biological and computational perspective, and to create algorithms and architectures that push the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

We will explore cutting-edge concepts such as:
- Neural network architectures and how they can be scaled for intelligence.
- Computational aspects, focusing on efficiency, scaling, and architectural inspirations from blockchain systems like Ethereum.
- Algorithms for intelligence based on cognitive models and decentralized computation.

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Algorithms and Architectures**:
    - Develop new architectures for neural networks inspired by natural and artificial intelligence.
    - Research and implement algorithms for scaling intelligence efficiently.

2. **Computing and Scaling**:
    - Investigate methods for scaling intelligence using distributed computing, with inspiration from Ethereum’s architecture.
    - Focus on optimization for neural networks and large-scale AI models.

3. **Research Papers and Ideas**:
    - Dive deep into research papers that discuss the evolution of intelligence, AI models, and computational architectures.

## Structure

- **Ideas**: A collection of research ideas, notes from the book, and future directions.
- **Research**: Summaries of relevant research papers and discussions of the latest AI trends.
- **Code**: Algorithms and neural network models designed to simulate intelligence and scale for complex computations.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of methodologies, architectures, and scaling strategies.
