# Scaling Neural Networks for Intelligence

Scaling neural networks is crucial for simulating more complex forms of intelligence. In this section, we will explore:

## Key Research Areas

1. **Distributed Learning**:
    - Decentralized learning systems can allow for greater scalability. Taking inspiration from blockchain systems, we can implement systems where multiple nodes contribute to the training and execution of neural networks.

2. **Ethereum-Inspired Models**:
    - By studying the architecture of Ethereum, we can explore ways to efficiently distribute computation across nodes, ensuring that AI systems can scale without bottlenecks.

3. **Parallel Processing**:
    - Techniques like parallel processing, where multiple processes contribute to a single neural network's learning, can greatly enhance efficiency.

## Future Directions

- Implement scaling algorithms that distribute neural network training across multiple nodes, inspired by Ethereumâ€™s smart contracts and consensus mechanisms.
