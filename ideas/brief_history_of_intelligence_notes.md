# Notes on *The Brief History of Intelligence* by Max Bennett

## Key Concepts

1. **Evolution of Intelligence**:
    - The book provides an in-depth look at how intelligence evolved, from simple organisms to complex brains.
    - **Neural networks**: Understanding the biological underpinnings of intelligence will help design artificial systems that simulate these processes.

2. **Cognitive Models of Intelligence**:
    - Human cognition serves as a blueprint for the development of AI systems. This includes memory, learning, and decision-making algorithms.

3. **Computing and Scaling**:
    - One key focus is on how we can scale these ideas using computing resources effectively. This draws parallels with blockchain systems like Ethereum for decentralized, efficient processing.

## Next Steps

- Investigate how **neural network architectures** can evolve to simulate cognitive processes.
- Study the Ethereum network to understand decentralized architectures and apply them to AI scaling.
