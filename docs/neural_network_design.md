# Neural Network Design

The **History of Intelligence** project explores the design and scaling of neural networks inspired by biological intelligence.

## Key Design Concepts

1. **Inspired by Cognitive Processes**:
    - The design is based on human cognitive processes like learning, memory, and decision-making.

2. **Scalable Architectures**:
    - We focus on creating architectures that can be easily scaled across multiple computing nodes, taking inspiration from decentralized networks like Ethereum.
